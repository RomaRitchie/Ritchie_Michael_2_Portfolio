# Ritchie_Michael_2_Portfolio

The purpose of my portfolio is to keep on ongoing record of my best work and to have the ability to restore my material to any previous point. The meaning of my portfolio is for the development of my identity, and my ability to reflect on how my pieces of my work are interpersonally related to each other and myself.
